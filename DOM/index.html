        - DOM: Document Object Model
            Allows our JS to interact with HTML and CSS.
            Is an object-oriented representation of a web page, which can be modified by JS.

            Two primary areas:
            1. Making a model of an HTML page
                - When the broswer loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory.
                - The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree.
                The DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree itself is made up of objects.
            2. Accessing and changing the HTML page
                - The DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object in the model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.

                    - getElementByClassName()
                    - getElementByTagname()

            ? MANIPULATING
                COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH HTML CONTENT
                    - innerHTML
                    - textContent
                    - createElement
                
                COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH TAG ATTRIBUTES
                    - className / id
                    - setAttribute()
                    - getAttribute()
     -->
     <h1>Hello World</h1>

     <!-- ! 1: getElementById -->
     <p id="testParagraph">Sample Text</p>

     <!-- ! 2: querySelectorAll / innerText/innerHTML -->
     <p class="sampleclass">A class paragraph</p>
     <p class="sampleclass">A class paragraph</p>
     <p class="sampleclass">A class paragraph</p>
     <p class="sampleclass">A class paragraph</p>
