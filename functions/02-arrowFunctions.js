//? ARROW FUNCTIONS
 - Arrow functions are expressional functions that can be simplified into one of two forms: CONCISE and BLOCK BODY.
 - The main goal is to generate shorter syntax for writing a function.


 * Arrow Functions also do NOT get hoisted.

/*
    1. *Arrow functions are always anonymous*
    2. Parameters are still capable of being injected.
        - if we only have one parameter, we techincally don't need the parens()
        - BUT if we are not passing any parameters, it is REQUIRED to denote ()
    3. This syntax tells JS that we are about to process a function.
    4. Within this format, JS assumes the return statement.
